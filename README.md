Insights generated:
- Seasonality in inventory increases from spring to summer, reaching its yearly high in summer. It starts decreasing in the fall and reaches its yearly lowest point in winter.
- The COVID pandemic reduced the size of inventory, leading to an increase in listing and sale prices.
- In 2021, list prices increased drastically, and the number of homes sold also rose. This year brought the highest benefit, with many houses being sold above the listed price.
- Sales prices for single and multi-family homes have been surpassing list prices since 2019, providing better opportunities for realtors in these markets.
